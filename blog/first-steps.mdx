# First steps

You can read this. That's good. It means I've built a functional blog in Next.JS that displays MDX content in a legible manner.

So far, I've built and set up:
- code quality checks and tests that run before commits and as part of build pipelines
- automated deployment to a DigitalOcean droplet
- custom components, complete with Storybook support
- custom functionality, covered in unit tests 
- support for displaying React components inside MDX files
- a landing page that displays metadata based on MDX files in my '/blog' folder
- breadcrumb navigation 
- a perfect score on Google Lighthouse checks

Hopefully, the foundations of the blog and the wider project are pretty solid now.

## Staring blocks

It's worth mentioning here that I've not started from zero on this project.

I've had a DigitalOcean droplet running for a few years. I've built Python scripts that scoop up football data on a daily basis and save it to a MariaDB database. I've also written an API using FastAPI to expose that data to the internet.

While I've been using a [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) Vue.JS front end for a while, I wanted to start again using React and Next.JS.

[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) seemed like a pretty good, well documented component library that could do the same job as Quasar. It's got some good [chart components](https://mantine.dev/charts/getting-started/) and examples of [combinations of its components](https://ui.mantine.dev/), including [statistics](https://ui.mantine.dev/category/stats/). Those should come in handy later on.

Thanks to the [Next repo template](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template) I was able to get started pretty quickly. The configuration includes linting, unit testing and it's got Storybook out of the box, for testing components.

So, with my repo ready to go, it's time to open up the IDE and write some code!

## Put that in your pipe

Well, maybe not quite yet.

The only bad thing that makes it to production should be the content of these blogs. Since I'm doing this alone, without code reviewers or quality assurance testers, I really do need all the automated tests I can get.

To make sure that's the case, I've used the pretty comprehensive commands from the default [package.json](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/package.json) to check the code. 

I've also made use of [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to run the same commands before I push a commit up to the project. This further reduces the risk of bad or broken code making its way up to production.

The site lives on a DigitalOcean droplet. Using the [appleboy/ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action), it's possible to SSH into the droplet, pull down the latest version of the main branch, build the site and serve it using [PM2](https://pm2.io/). The GitHub Action deletes any existing job and starts a new one any time a deployment completes.

I've set up a restricted user to manage the deployments. The GitHub action makes use of a bunch of secrets to avoid exposing any details to the world.

So, with a basic app set up, pull request checks and automated deployments, it's time to open up the IDE and write some code!

## Putting it together

Getting the initial 'Welcome!' page visible locally took a simple `yarn install` and `yarn dev`.

The 'Welcome' component lives in a folder made up of files that demonstrate how to build a component 'properly':
- [`Welcome.module.css`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.module.css) - some basic styling to demonstrate CSS modules
- [`Welcome.story.tsx`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.story.tsx) - a simple story for rendering in Storybook
- [`Welcome.test.tsx`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.test.tsx) -  a simple component test
- [`Welcome.tsx`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.tsx) - the component itself, which pulls all of this together and includes some core Mantine components

Having used Quasar, I'm used to what Mantine has to offer - the documentation is also crucially very good across both projects. Throwing together the initial page layout wasn't too much of a concern.

## Mark it down

It was encouraging to see that [Mantine's own documentation site](https://help.mantine.dev/q/server-components) make use of [ Markdown files](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine/blob/0b7ccbfe061b4e07c83c14747e612c89507db3b8/apps/help.mantine.dev/src/pages/q/server-components.mdx).

Next.JS has [some good documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) on setting up Markdown, crucially involving an `mdx-components.tsx` file. Mantine components work nicely with this, with things like the [Title](https://mantine.dev/core/title/) component easily pulled in to handle all heading tags.

It does also support printing components straight into the blog. For example:

import { Switch } from '@mantine/core';

<Switch
    label="Turn off my device"
    description="The author takes no responsibility data lost on using this element"
/>

That means I get to show off my custom components right here in an interactive way, instead of screenshotting and describing them.

## Dynamic loading and metadata

On the [Posts](/posts) page, I've dynamically pulled through the list of MDX files from the project's `/blog` folder.

With Frontmatter - and [this excellent guide by Joseph Rex](https://www.josephrex.me/frontmatter-with-nextjs-and-mdx/) - my MDX files contain metadata which is processed both by the blog page and by the [Posts](/posts) page. This gives me a nice SEO friendly page header, as well as info I can filter on the [Posts](/posts) page.

I've built some functionality that gathers my files, extracts the metadata and then filters based on `published` and orders by `publishDate`. This lets me write blogs in advance and then set them live with a very small pull request.

## Styling and theming

I'm not much of a designer, but I know enough to appreciate that things I've designed myself, have _felt wrong_. It's why I've opted for a front end component library, rather than build everything myself.

The theming and components out of the boxs look nice enough, if a _little_ boring.

I've been looking to use [RandomA11y](https://randoma11y.com/) on a project for a while. It generates a random palette of two colours that contrast enough to conform to APCA standards. After bashing the 'Generate' button a few times, I found this blue and green pairing.

You've managed to read this far, so it's probably not too bad.

## Custom components

To make the blog a bit more 'bloggy', I've added in:
- BlogBreadcrumbs - an element that lists the current navigation route
- BlogListItem - an element that displays metadata for a post and links to it

The breadcrumbs make use of the base [Breadcrumb component](https://mantine.dev/core/breadcrumbs/), but with the 'home' always included. There's nothing too exciting going on here.

import { BlogBreadcrumb } from '@/components/blog/BlogBreadcrumb/BlogBreadcrumb';

<BlogBreadcrumb 
    breadcrumbItems={[{ href: "/posts", title: "Posts" }, { href: "/posts/first-steps", title: "First steps" },]} 
/>

The blog list element is also essentially a structured [Card component](https://mantine.dev/core/card/), populating with the respective prop data. Here they are in a grid to show even heights, even when data is missing.

import { BlogListItem } from '@/components/blog/BlogListItem/BlogListItem';

<BlogListItem 
    title='Hello world!' 
    description='This links to the first blog post' 
    slug='hello-world' 
    published={true}
    publishDate='2025-03-01T00:00:00' 
/>

The card component doesn't have a style prop for spacing between elements, so I've used Mantine's support for [CSS modules](https://mantine.dev/styles/css-modules/) to add that in instead.

import { Grid, GridCol } from '@mantine/core';

<Grid grow>
    <GridCol key={ 0 } span={{ base: 12, sm: 6, lg: 4 }} mb="xl">
        <BlogListItem 
            title='No description' 
            slug='hello-world'
            published={true}
            publishDate='2025-03-01T00:00:00' 
        />
    </GridCol>
    <GridCol key={ 1 } span={{ base: 12, sm: 6, lg: 4 }} mb="xl">
        <BlogListItem 
            title='No publish date'
            description='This links to the first blog post'
            slug='hello-world'
            published={true}
        />
    </GridCol>
</Grid>

## Perfect scores

With all of this in place, I deployed the blog with my ['Hello world!'](/posts/hello-world) post and ran it through Lighthouse checks.

Next.js and Mantine are pretty well tuned for performance, and I've included metadata for SEO, so both of those scores 100 immediately.

There was an initial few tweaks to be made around accessibility scores - in particular, the spacing around the links. I also wasn't respecting heading hierarchy for aesthetic reasons, which is not a good enough reason to mess with accessibility. 

With those bits sorted, this site now gets the full 100 across the board.

## A major blocker

At this point, I hit a significant hurdle that has derailed many a side project - I didn't want to write this. I wanted to go make the cool stuff instead.

It's a fairly natural instinct, I hope. This is a break from my day job, but also resembles my day job. The highs and lows are emphasised as a result. The draw of building some cool stuff is stronger and doing the admin tasks feels even more like work.

The plan was to have a publishing schedule that forced cracking through the tasks at a pretty steady clip. However, I'm giving myself deadlines _for fun_. That's a pretty solid path towards burn out and letting this project go to rot.

Here's what I did about it: I gave in to that feeling. 

I went and built the next step of the project before writing this blog. Having cool stuff I want to show off was the motivator I needed to come back and finish off this first stage.

Although, I did then absolutely race through the first draft of this blog. It threw up a bunch of stuff I want to be part of the project that I hadn't done.

## Testing the custom components

...can wait until another post. This one is long enough already, don't you think?

## I made a blog

Thanks to how mature and well documented Next.JS and Mantine are, pulling together a static blog made up of Markdown files has been pretty easy. What's been encouraging is how powerful everything is out of the box. There's a lot in this initial build and from here on out, it should _Just Work_.

Being able to embed components in MDX is incredibly powerful. While it's possible to describe what something does, or take a screenshot, it doesn't compare to actually having the element in the page.

It's also been handy in writing this post. At times, the claims I've been making about components have been lies. Embedding the components in the page exposed them pretty cleanly. That gave me reason and motivation to make them work like I thought they did.

Hopefully, the foundations are now solid enough for the forseeable. Inevitably I'm going to need some quality of life improvements (should there be a 'Next' and 'Previous' link at the bottom of these pages? Probably). This should take me where I need to go, though. 

Next up: pulling data from an API into the app.
