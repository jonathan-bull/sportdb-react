# First steps

I want to build a blog that displays MDX content so I can quickly throw together posts documenting this project as I go.

Before we get to anything complicated, I'm going to need the absolute foundations of this project.

So, I've built and set up:
- a basic site layout with navigation and a landing page
- code quality checks and tests that run before commits and as part of build pipelines
- automated deployment to a DigitalOcean droplet
- a perfect score on Google Lighthouse checks

From here, we can start to build some cool stuff.

## Staring blocks

First, some history on the project so far.

I've had a DigitalOcean droplet running for a few years. I've built Python scripts that scoop up football data on a daily basis and save it to a MariaDB database. I've also written an API using FastAPI to expose that data to the internet.

At various points, my focus has shifted. At points, I tried to:
- use PyTorch and a bit of Bayseian theory to calculate match outcomes
- take datasets to generate a score for the impact an individual has had on a match
- generate text reports based on live API data, converted to speech

The goals have been large. The process has been fun. The results have been mixed.

Here, I'm aiming for a more modest goal of building a front end for my existing database and API, increasing in complexity as I go.

While I've been using a [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) Vue.JS front end for a while, I wanted to start again using React and Next.JS.

[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) seemed like a pretty good, well documented component library that could do the same job as Quasar. It's got some good [chart components](https://mantine.dev/charts/getting-started/) and examples of [combinations of its components](https://ui.mantine.dev/), including [statistics](https://ui.mantine.dev/category/stats/). Those should come in handy later on.

Thanks to the [Next repo template](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template) I was able to get started pretty quickly. The configuration includes linting, unit testing and it's got Storybook out of the box, for testing components.

So, with my repo ready to go, it's time to open up the IDE and write some code!

## Put that in your pipe

Well, maybe not quite yet.

The only bad thing that makes it to production should be the content of these blogs. Since I'm doing this alone, without code reviewers or quality assurance testers, I really do need all the automated tests I can get.

To make sure that's the case, I've used the pretty comprehensive commands from the default [package.json](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/package.json) to check the code. 

I've also made use of [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to run the same commands before I push a commit up to the project. This further reduces the risk of bad or broken code making its way up to production.

The site lives on a DigitalOcean droplet. Using the [appleboy/ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action), it's possible to SSH into the droplet, pull down the latest version of the main branch, build the site and serve it using [PM2](https://pm2.io/). The GitHub Action deletes any existing job and starts a new one any time a deployment completes.

I've set up a restricted user to manage the deployments. The GitHub action makes use of a bunch of secrets to avoid exposing any details to the world.

So, with a basic app set up, pull request checks and automated deployments, it's time to open up the IDE and write some code!

## Putting it together

Getting the initial 'Welcome!' page visible locally took a simple `yarn install` and `yarn dev`.

The 'Welcome' component lives in a folder made up of files that demonstrate how to build a component 'properly':
- [`Welcome.module.css`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.module.css) - some basic styling to demonstrate CSS modules
- [`Welcome.story.tsx`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.story.tsx) - a simple story for rendering in Storybook
- [`Welcome.test.tsx`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.test.tsx) -  a simple component test
- [`Welcome.tsx`](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/blob/master/components/Welcome/Welcome.tsx) - the component itself, which pulls all of this together and includes some core Mantine components

Having used Quasar, I'm used to what Mantine has to offer - the documentation is also crucially very good across both projects. 

Throwing together the initial page layout wasn't too much of a concern, especially adapting the example 'Welcome' component to create my own landing page.

## Styling and theming

I'm not much of a designer, but I know enough to appreciate that things I've designed myself, have _felt wrong_. It's why I've opted for a front end component library, rather than build everything myself.

The theming and components out of the boxs look nice enough, if a _little_ boring.

I've been looking to use [RandomA11y](https://randoma11y.com/) on a project for a while. It generates a random palette of two colours that contrast enough to conform to APCA standards. After bashing the 'Generate' button a few times, I found this blue and green pairing.

You've managed to read this far, so it's probably not too bad.

Issues have arisen from Mantine's default colour scheme, which expects ten shades of each colour and uses grey shades between its absolute white and black. At various points, I've needed to extend their [theme object](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/) in order to match my monochrome style. While their [Styles API](https://mantine.dev/styles/styles-api/) includes variables for most instances where I need to overwrite colours, in some cases it absolutely does not.

## A major blocker

At this point, I hit a significant hurdle that has derailed many a side project - I didn't want to write this. I wanted to go make the cool stuff instead.

It's a fairly natural instinct, I hope. This is a break from my day job, but also resembles my day job. The highs and lows are emphasised as a result. The draw of building some cool stuff is stronger and doing the admin tasks feels even more like work.

The plan was to have a publishing schedule that forced cracking through the tasks at a pretty steady clip. However, I'm giving myself deadlines for fun. That's a pretty solid path towards burn out and letting this project go to rot.

Here's what I did about it: I gave in to that feeling.

I carried on building more of the project before coming back to writing this blog. Having cool stuff I want to show off was the push I needed to come back and finish off this write up.

## Everything in its right place

So, I've ended up with:
- a home page
- a simple navigation menu
- support for light/dark mode

**Next time:** [building a blog that displays Markdown files](/posts/building-a-blog). Will I manage it? Who can say?
