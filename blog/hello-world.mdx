# Hello World!

Hello, and welcome. I'm going to attempt to build a site using Next.JS to render football data from an API I've already written.

The aim is to make this as professionally as possible, including TypeScript, unit testing, component testing and automated deployments.

### Why are we here?

For as long as I can remember, I've always been really into about football. Kick abouts during lunch breaks and after school, completing the sticker books, taping Match of the Day, listening to live commentary on Five Live, wearing kits on non uniform day (full kit, shamefully). Completely obsessed.

Unfortunately, my career as footballer was cut cruelly short by a severe and irreversible lack of athletic ability.

I've managed to carve out a decent career in my other interest - going on the computer. I've mostly worked in the WordPress world, including building sites for some sports teams and competitions.

WordPress has allowed me exposure to _some_ TypeScript and React, but not Next.JS and not on the front end.

So, let's build a proper project using all those fancy modern tools, then.

### What are we starting with?

A few years ago, I built a Python CLI that interacts with a database using SQLAlchemy to connect to a MariaDB database.

I've previously built a Vue.JS front end using [Quasar](quasar.dev). I build a Flask API to interact with it, later rewriting it in FastAPI.

Maybe this will need writing about should there be overwhelming demand. For now, let's not worry about it too much.

### What's the plan?

Over the coming months, I'm aiming to slowly build up a functioning website here, with complexity increasing as we go.

I've made a decision to use [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) as a component library for two reasons. 

The first reason is it's seems pretty cool. It's TypeScript based and it's possible to build [some nice looking stuff](https://ui.mantine.dev/).

The second reason is I'm doing this as a side project in my spare time. Ideally, it'll be fun. A component library hopefully allows for more focus on the fun and less time stuck in the weeds.

I've broken the whole thing down step by step. I've not converted them into JIRA tickets or anything. These will magically become blog posts detailing my process as the project progresses.

* [First steps](/posts/first-steps) - setting up a Next.JS blog that displays Markdown data and deploys via GitHub
* a simple team page - a page that pulls in simple data from an API and renders it on the page
* expanding the team page - adding more components to the team page, including kit displays
* fixture lists - listing a team's fixtures, allowing filtering and pagination
* fixture list page - extending the fixture list to be used on its own page
* single fixture page - gather data for a single fixture and display match events, lineups and match statistics
* competition page - a list of teams, ordered by results, filterable by date
* person page - display simple data for an individual person
* statistic lists - display lists of statistical data, with filters
* charts and graphs - rendering statistical data visually, with controls for changing display
* complex filtering - allow for fancier filtering that lets us send more complex queries to the API

If you can read this, the first part is working, at least.

### Why are you doing this?

A fair question. These things are supposed to be profound explorations of the self and our place in an ever changing technological landscape, aren't they?

I just think it's a fun thing to do, gang - challenging myself, learning new stuff, that sort of thing. There's not that much to it.

Cheers, now.
