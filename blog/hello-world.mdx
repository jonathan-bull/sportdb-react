# Hello World!

Hello, and welcome. I'm going to attempt to build a site using Next.JS to render football data from an API I've already written.

The aim is to make this as professionally as possible, including:
* TypeScript
* unit testing
* component testing 
* automated deployments
* making the whole thing as performant as possible

## Why are we here?

For as long as I can remember, I've always been really into about football. Kick abouts during lunch breaks and after school, completing the sticker books, listening to live commentary on Five Live, wearing kits on non uniform day (full kit, shamefully), populating the league ladder wallchart from Match until they broke about a month into the season. Fully obsessed.

Unfortunately, my career playing football was cut cruelly short by a severe and irreversible lack of any athletic ability.

I've managed to carve out a decent career in my other interest - going on the computer. I've mostly worked in the WordPress world, including building sites for some sports teams and competitions. WordPress has allowed me exposure to _some_ TypeScript and React. However, the back end is very much PHP and their front end uses a wrapper of React with some additions and limitations.

So, let's build a proper project using all those fancy modern tools, then.

## What are we starting with?

A few years ago, I built a Python CLI that interacts with a database using SQLAlchemy to connect to a MariaDB database.

I've previously built a Vue.JS front end using [Quasar](https://quasar.dev). I built a Flask API to interact with it, later rewriting it in FastAPI.

There may be some posts about that in future, should there be sufficient/any demand. For now, let's not worry about it too much.

## What's the plan?

Over the coming months, I'm aiming to slowly build up a functioning website, with increasing complexity.

I've made a decision to use [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) as a component library for two reasons. 

The first reason is it's seems pretty cool. It's TypeScript based and it's possible to build [some nice looking stuff](https://ui.mantine.dev/) quite quickly.

The second reason is I'm doing this as a side project in my spare time. A component library hopefully allows for more focus on the fun and less time stuck in the weeds.

I've broken the whole thing down step by step. There's no JIRA board, but there's some clear tasks. Each of these will magically become blog posts detailing my process as the project progresses.

* [first steps](/posts/first-steps) - setting up a simple site with Mantine and Next.JS that deploys to Digital Ocean via GitHub
* [building a blog](/posts/building-a-blog) - creating a simple blog that displays Markdown data
* a simple team page - a page that pulls in simple data from an API and renders it on the page
* expanding the team page - adding more components to the team page, including kit displays
* fixture lists - listing a team's fixtures, allowing filtering and pagination
* fixture list page - extending the fixture list to be used on its own page
* single fixture page - gather data for a single fixture and display match events, lineups and match statistics
* competition page - a list of teams, ordered by results, filterable by date
* person page - display simple data for an individual person
* statistic lists - display lists of statistical data, with filters
* charts and graphs - rendering statistical data visually, with controls for changing display
* complex filtering - allow for fancier filtering that lets us send more complex queries to the API

If you can read this, the first part is working, at least.

## Why are you doing this?

It's a fair question.

The idea is largely to set a bunch of relatively achievable targets and, by writing about it publicly, have a level of accountability.

I'm going to learn plenty about TypeScript, React, Next JS, self hosting and interacting with APIs. It would be cool to get some feedback along the way too.

If this project is going to move numbers on LinkedIn, it needs to go deeper than that. What does this tell me about myself, or making websites? Will I demonstrate a High Performance mindset? Will I make a controversial opening statement and contradict myself by the end? Will I end up on a podcast?

Really, though, when I give it full consideration, I just think it's a fun thing to do.

Sometimes that can be enough.
